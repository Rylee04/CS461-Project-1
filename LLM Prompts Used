1. I'm trying to write a program in python that goes through a few different algorithms for route-finding given a "coordinates.csv" file with city names and their coordinates on each line and an "Adjacencies.txt" file with two city names on each line

The program should compare the time taken for execution on each one. The algorithms in mind are breadth-first search, depth-first search, iterative deepening-depth first search, and A*.

2. Could you modify the code so that it has a menu and asks the user for the start and end city (making sure both are in the database) and asks for which search they'd like to use?

3. Could you modify the program so it also includes best-first search?

4. Can you modify the code so that it prints the route the method found in order from origin to destination?

5. can you also modify the code so that it calculates and displays the total distance (node to node) for the cities visited on the route selected?
here's an example of the first three lines of "coordinates.txt":
Abilene 38.92203 -97.2667
Andover 37.68684 -97.1658
Anthony 37.15752 -98.0729

6. I'd like the execution time to be more exact since it's often giving me that it's completed in 0.000 seconds when I want to be able to see the trend of how long each algorithm takes to finish path finding\

7. Could you comment out the program?

8. iddfs is missing its max_depth
